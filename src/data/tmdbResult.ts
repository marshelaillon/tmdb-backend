As the  inquiry unfolds in present day through separate interrogations, the two  former detectives narrate the story of their investigation, reopening  unhealed wounds, and drawing into question their supposed solving of a  bizarre ritualistic murder in 1995. The timelines braid and converge in  2012 as each man is pulled back into a world they believed they'd left  behind. In learning about each other and their killer, it becomes clear  that darkness lives on both sides of the law.",
